            <p class="paragraph">
                Overhunting is an activity which results in serious reduction of species population or harm to wildlife.
                It is otherwise defined as the relentless chase for wild or game animals for the purpose of killing or
                catching them for economic or personal gains or for food. In several parts of the world, people continue
                to depend on wildlife for many needs and it is the act of killing, capturing or hunting down more
                animals than their populations can supply that contributes to overhunting.

                Because of the interconnectedness of the ecosystem, the long-term effect of taking these species from
                their natural environments is devastating as it not only threatens their survival but also the survival
                of other species. Let’s have a close look at the specific causes of overhunting, its consequences and
                solutions to the problem.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Tribes and indigenous people hunted and killed to observe tradition and culture, and for various
                beliefs. In the contemporary world, there are communities and tribes that still practice these
                activities. For instance, some ethnic groups living next to the oceans hunt turtles and use them to make
                soup which is believed to make them stronger.

                As a result, some turtle species are in the verge of extinction in Vietnam because of this superstitious
                practice. In Africa, the Maasai tribe hunts lions as a rite of passage to gain recognition for their
                bravery. Various ethnic groups across the world also involve in such practices by killing orangutans,
                gibbons, monkeys and whales on the basis of different traditional and religious beliefs.

                Collectively, these practices have resulted in overhunting and the endangerment of species. Whale and
                Orangutan hunting in Japan and Borneo respectively have, for instance, endangered the species because of
                some of the long-held traditions, rituals and cultural practices.

            <h1 class="header">We must stop the overexploitation.</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The increase of human populations across the world has significantly increased, thereby seeing high
                number of people encroaching into wild areas that has extensively lead to poaching and mass hunting. The
                increase of number of people has also contributed to high demands for food and other raw materials only
                obtainable from wildlife. These are some of the most deliberate and continuous hunting activities that
                contribute to overhunting.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since the first time humans set foot on the planet, they’ve always hunted for food. Furthermore, some of
                the earliest archaeological paintings and cave paintings reveal the dependence of pre-historic man on
                hunting for food. To date, men still hunt for food and coupled with the ever increasing human population
                and environmental needs, people continue to engage even more on the activity which has led to
                overhunting.

                The continued growth of human population means the need for more and more food that makes it difficult
                for some species to regenerate. What makes the matter worse is that it’s now done by big businesses that
                engage in the activity on a very expansive scale.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Hunting for sport or fun is a huge activity in various parts of the world. In some areas the hunters are
                even awarded prizes or money for each animal hunted depending on the species. The practice is legal in
                some places like the hunting Safaris in Africa while in others it is done illegally. Sometimes the
                people engaging in such practices do not understand the harm they are causing to wildlife.

                The hunting and killing for fun or sport for animal species like lions, elephants and monkeys have
                considerably contributed to overhunting of such species. The hunting and shooting of birds is a
                quintessential fun activity that has impacted many bird species.

            <h1 class="header">This one will hurt us too.</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since the 17th century, excessive hunting is recorded as the third most notorious cause of animal
                extension. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) reports that overhunting is responsible for 23% of extinctions.
                Many humans are forcing animals into extinction by over-consuming them or killing them for economic
                gains.

                Historically, overhunting is the cause of the extinctions of giant lemurs and elephant birds in
                Madagascar, Miss Waldron’s red colobus monkey in Ghana, moas in New Zealand, Alagoas currasow in
                northeastern Brazil and giant kangaroos in Australia.
                Hunting is proven to interfere with hibernation and migration of the animals. The reason for this is
                that when animals are hunted and killed during migration and hibernation, they develop fear of being
                killed which may eventually make them desist from migrating or hibernating.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Overhunting not only affects the animals but also affects the entire biosphere. Consequently, it affects
                the interconnectedness of the ecosystem since the living organisms need each other together with their
                natural habit to survive. In other words, hunting disturbs the natural order and since every ecosystem
                is unique and different, the removal of a living creature from their natural environment results in an
                unbalanced ecosystem. The dire consequences are the possibilities of overpopulation due to the
                incapability to keep one population at their natural levels or extinction due to lack of food.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                With reference to how overhunting affects the interconnectedness of the ecosystem, it means other
                animals, trees, and plants are equally affected. As previously discussed, it causes either an increase
                or decline of a specific population within a habitat. When this happens, it directly impacts the natural
                habitat in that it gets rid of natural predation and population growth which in turn disrupts the food
                chain.
                When hunters make way into the forests or other wild areas, they destroy the natural environments and
                add carbon footprint by emitting carbon dioxide from their vehicles. The camp sites set up upon arrival
                at the desired hunting locations also commonly lead to lots of littering. The smoke emitted from the
                campfires also negatively affects both wildlife and their natural environments.

            <h1 class="header">What can we do about it?</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The most imperative way to curtail overhunting is the enforcement of stricter laws, especially those
                barring activities such as illegal animal trade and poaching. Policies should also limit the manufacture
                of products from endangered animal extracts such as tigers, bears and whales. Enforcement of laws to
                regulate the consumption of game meat will similarly offer better strategies for managing hunting
                activities. Laws can likewise be instituted to closely monitor and properly manage legal hunting for fun
                or as a sport to help conserve wilderness ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The social media, the internet, and other awareness creation platforms such as schools are vital
                resources for informing people the repercussions of overhunting and the importance of desisting from the
                practice. The documentation of the problems associated with overhunting wild meat should constitute the
                initial steps. Conservation campaigns and reporting on illegal hunting as well as poaching should then
                follow particularly by putting special emphasis on the endangered species.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We as the custodians of planet earth can help ameliorate the problem by supporting or funding
                conservation agencies such as the World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society, Oceana,
                Conservation International, and International Fund for Animal Welfare just to mention a few. Most of
                these agencies devote to protected natural and wildlife environments from any danger including hunting.
                Again as the custodians of the planet, we can offer solution to the problem by boycotting and avoiding
                the purchase of products with animal parts or those processed with raw materials obtained from
                endangered species. Examples include leather coats, clothes with furs, beauty creams, make-ups, body
                oils, and pretty ornaments with parts made of shells or tusks of endangered creatures. If unsure about
                the raw materials used to make the product, there is no need of buying it.
