                Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest. This can
                include clearing the land for agriculture or grazing, or using the timber for fuel, construction or
                manufacturing.
                Forests cover more than 30% of the Earth's land surface, according to the World Wildlife Fund. These
                forested areas can provide food, medicine and fuel for more than a billion people. Worldwide, forests
                provide 13.4 million people with jobs in the forest sector, and another 41 million people have jobs
                related to forests.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Forests are a resource, but they are also large, undeveloped swaths of land that can be converted for
                purposes such as agriculture and grazing. In North America, about half the forests in the eastern part
                of the continent were cut down for timber and farming between the 1600s and late 1800s, according to
                National Geographic.
                Today, most deforestation is happening in the tropics. Areas that were inaccessible in the past are now
                within reach as new roads are constructed through the dense forests. A 2017 report by scientists at the
                University of Maryland showed that the tropics lost about 61,000 square miles (158,000 square
                kilometers) of forest in 2017 — an area the size of Bangladesh.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The World Bank estimates that about 3.9 million square miles (10 million square km) of forest have been
                lost since the beginning of the 20th century. In the past 25 years, forests shrank by 502,000 square
                miles (1.3 million square km) — an area bigger than the size of South Africa. In 2018, The Guardian
                reported that every second, a chunk of forest equivalent to the size of a soccer field is lost.
                Often, deforestation occurs when forested area is cut and cleared to make way for agriculture or
                grazing. The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reports that just four commodities are responsible for
                tropical deforestation: beef, soy, palm oil and wood products. UCS estimates that an area the size of
                Switzerland (14,800 square miles, or 38,300 square km) is lost to deforestation every year.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Natural fires in tropical forests tend to be rare but intense. Human-lit fires are commonly used to
                clear land for agricultural use. First, valuable timber is harvested, then the remaining vegetation is
                burned to make way for crops like soy or cattle grazing. In 2019, the number of human-lit fires in
                Brazil skyrocketed. As of August 2019, more than 80,000 fires burned in the Amazon, an increase of
                almost 80% from 2018, National Geographic reported.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Many forests are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. Palm oil is the most commonly
                produced
                vegetable oil and is found in half of all supermarket products. It's cheap, versatile and can be
                added
                to both food and personal products like lipsticks and shampoo. Its popularity has spurred people to
                clear tropical forests to grow more palm trees. Growing the trees that produce the oil requires the
                leveling of native forest and the destruction of local peatlands — which doubles the harmful effect
                on
                the ecosystem. According to a report published by Zion Market Research, the global palm oil market
                was
                valued at $65.73 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach $92.84 billion in 2021.

                Forests can be found from the tropics to high-latitude areas. They are home to 80% of terrestrial
                biodiversity, containing a wide array of trees, plants, animals and microbes, according to the World
                Bank, an international financial institution. Some places are especially diverse — the tropical forests
                of New Guinea, for example, contain more than 6% of the world's species of plants and animals.
                Forests provide more than a home for a diverse collection of living things; they are also an important
                resource for many around the world. In countries like Uganda, people rely on trees for firewood, timber
                and charcoal. Over the past 25 years, Uganda has lost 63% of its forest cover, Reuters reported.
                Families send children — primarily girls — to collect firewood, and kids have to trek farther and
                farther to get to the trees.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Collecting enough wood often takes all day, so the children miss school.
                According to a 2018 FAO report, three-quarters of the Earth’s freshwater comes from forested watersheds,
                and the loss of trees can affect water quality. The UN's 2018 State of the World's Forests report found
                that over half the global population relies on forested watersheds for their drinking water as well as
                water used for agriculture and industry.
                Trees also absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity. As
                climate change continues, trees play an important role in carbon sequestration, or the capture and
                storage of excess carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Tropical trees alone are estimated to provide about 23% of the climate
                mitigation that's needed to offset climate change, according to the World Resources Institute, a
                nonprofit global research institute.
                Deforestation not only removes vegetation that is important for removing carbon dioxide from the air,
                but the act of clearing the forests also produces greenhouse gas emissions. The Food and Agriculture
                Organization of the United Nations says that deforestation is the second-leading cause of climate
                change. (The first is the burning of fossil fuels.) In fact, deforestation accounts for nearly 20% of
                greenhouse gas emissions.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Developing alternatives to deforestation can help decrease the need for tree clearing. For example, the
                desire to expand the amount of land used for agriculture is an attractive reason to deforest an area.
                But if people adopted sustainable farming practices or employed new farming technologies and crops, the
                need for more land might be diminished, according to the UN's Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Forests can also be restored, through replanting trees in cleared areas or simply allowing the forest
                ecosystem to regenerate over time. The goal of restoration is to return the forest to its original
                state, before it was cleared, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The sooner a cleared area is
                reforested, the quicker the ecosystem can start to repair itself. Afterward, wildlife will return, water
                systems will reestablish, carbon will be sequestered and soils will be replenished.
                Everyone can do their part to curb deforestation. We can buy certified wood products, go paperless
                whenever possible, limit our consumption of products that use palm oil and plant a tree when possible.

                In order to acquire the world's demand for wood, it is suggested that high yielding forest plantations
                are suitable according to forest writers Botkins and Sedjo. Plantations that yield 10 cubic meters per
                hectare a year would supply enough wood for trading of 5% of the world's existing forestland. By
                contrast, natural forests produce about 1–2 cubic meters per hectare; therefore, 5–10 times more
                forestland would be required to meet demand. Forester Chad Oliver has suggested a forest mosaic with
                high-yield forest lands interspersed with conservation land.
                Globally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and
                2015. Plantation forests made up 280 million ha in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the
                last ten years. Globally, planted forests consist of about 18% exotic or introduced species while
                the rest are species native to the country where they are planted. In South America, Oceania, and East
                and Southern Africa, planted forests are dominated by introduced species: 88%, 75% and 65%,
                respectively. In North America, West and Central Asia, and Europe the proportions of introduced species
                in plantations are much lower at 1%, 3% and 8% of the total area planted, respectively.
