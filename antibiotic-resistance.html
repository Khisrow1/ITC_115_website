            <p class="paragraph">
                Antibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance occurs
                when bacteria change in response to the use of these medicines.
                Bacteria, not humans or animals, become antibiotic-resistant. These bacteria may infect humans and
                animals, and the infections they cause are harder to treat than those caused by non-resistant bacteria.
                Antibiotic resistance leads to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality.
                The world urgently needs to change the way it prescribes and uses antibiotics. Even if new medicines are
                developed, without behaviour change, antibiotic resistance will remain a major threat. Behaviour changes
                must also include actions to reduce the spread of infections through vaccination, hand washing,
                practising safer sex, and good food hygiene.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Antibiotic resistance is rising to dangerously high levels in all parts of the world. New resistance
                mechanisms are emerging and spreading globally, threatening our ability to treat common infectious
                diseases. A growing list of infections – such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhoea,
                and foodborne diseases – are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become
                less effective.
                Where antibiotics can be bought for human or animal use without a prescription, the emergence and spread
                of resistance is made worse. Similarly, in countries without standard treatment guidelines, antibiotics
                are often over-prescribed by health workers and veterinarians and over-used by the public.
                Without urgent action, we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor
                injuries can once again kill.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Antimicrobial resistance (AMR or AR) is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication
                that once could successfully treat the microbe. The term antibiotic resistance (AR or ABR) is a
                subset of AMR, as it applies only to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. Resistant microbes
                are more difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses of antimicrobials. These
                approaches may be more expensive, more toxic or both. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are
                called multidrug resistant (MDR). Those considered extensively drug resistant (XDR) or totally
                drug-resistant (TDR) are sometimes called "superbugs".
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria,
                genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. All classes of microbes can
                develop resistance. Fungi develop antifungal resistance. Viruses develop antiviral resistance. Protozoa
                develop antiprotozoal resistance, and bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. Resistance can appear
                spontaneously because of random mutations. However, extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage
                selection for mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by use of antimicrobials in humans and other animals, and spread
                of resistant strains between the two. Growing resistance has also been linked to dumping of
                inadequately treated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry, especially in countries where bulk
                drugs are manufactured. Antibiotics increase selective pressure in bacterial populations, causing
                vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing.
                Even at very low levels of antibiotic, resistant bacteria can have a growth advantage and grow faster
                than vulnerable bacteria. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need
                for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug
                development is becoming rarer.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Self medication by consumers is defined as “the taking of medicines on one's own initiative or on
                another person's suggestion, who is not a certified medical professional”, and it has been identified as
                one of the primary reasons for the development of antimicrobial resistance. In an effort to manage
                their own illness, patients take the advice of false media sources, friends, and family causing them to
                take antimicrobials unnecessarily or in excess. Many people resort to this out of necessity, when they
                have a limited amount of money to see a doctor, or in many developing countries a poorly developed
                economy and lack of doctors are the cause of self-medication. In these developing countries, governments
                resort to allowing the sale of antimicrobials as over the counter medications so people could have
                access to them without having to find or pay to see a medical professional. This increased access
                makes it extremely easy to obtain antimicrobials without the advice of a physician, and as a result many
                antimicrobials are taken incorrectly leading to resistant microbial strains. One major example of a
                place that faces these challenges is India, where in a state called Punjab 73% of the population
                resorted to treating their minor health issues and chronic illnesses through self-medication.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The major issue with self-medication is the lack of knowledge of the public on the dangerous effects of
                antimicrobial resistance, and how they can contributing to it through mistreating or misdiagnosing
                themselves. In order to determine the public's knowledge and preconceived notions on antibiotic
                resistance, a major type of antimicrobial resistance, a screening of 3537 articles published in Europe,
                Asia, and North America was done. Of the 55,225 total people surveyed, 70% had heard of antibiotic
                resistance previously, but 88% of those people thought it referred to some type of physical change in
                the body. With so many people around the world with the ability to self-medicate using antibiotics,
                and a vast majority unaware of what antimicrobial resistance is, it makes the increase of antimicrobial
                resistance much more likely.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Clinical misuse by healthcare professionals is another cause leading to increased antimicrobial
                resistance. Studies done by the CDC show that the indication for treatment of antibiotics, choice of the
                agent used, and the duration of therapy was incorrect in up to 50% of the cases studied. In another
                study done in an intensive care unit in a major hospital in France, it was shown that 30% to 60% of
                prescribed antibiotics were unnecessary. These inappropriate uses of antimicrobial agents promote
                the development of antimicrobial resistance by supporting the bacteria in developing genetic alterations
                that lead to resistance. In a study done by the American Journal of Infection Control
                aimed to evaluate physicians’ attitudes and knowledge on antimicrobial resistance in ambulatory
                settings, only 63% of those surveyed reported antibiotic resistance as a problem in their local
                practices, while 23% reported the aggressive prescription of antibiotics as necessary to avoid failing
                to provide adequate care. This demonstrates how a majority of doctors underestimate the impact that
                their own prescribing habits have on antimicrobial resistance as a whole. It also confirms that some
                physicians may be overly cautious when it comes to prescribing antibiotics for both medical or legal
                reasons, even when indication for use for these medications is not always confirmed. This can lead to
                unnecessary antimicrobial use.

            <p class="paragraph">
                There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a
                proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still
                needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a
                global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature
                would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluating
                programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Antibiotic stewardship programmes appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance. The
                antibiotic stewardship program will also provide pharmacists with the knowledge to educate patients that
                antibiotics will not work for a virus.
                Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic
                resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range
                of disease. Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic
                resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed
                individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like
                the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper
                respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics. These
                prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic
                resistant bacteria.

                Infectious disease control through improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure needs to
                be included in the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda. The "Interagency Coordination Group on
                Antimicrobial Resistance" stated in 2018 that "the spread of pathogens through unsafe water results in a
                high burden of gastrointestinal disease, increasing even further the need for antibiotic treatment."
                This is particularly a problem in developing countries where the spread of infectious diseases caused by
                inadequate WASH standards is a major driver of antibiotic demand. Growing usage of antibiotics
                together with persistent infectious disease levels have led to a dangerous cycle in which reliance on
                antimicrobials increases while the efficacy of drugs diminishes. The proper use of infrastructure
                for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) can result in a 47–72 percent decrease of diarrhea cases
                treated with antibiotics depending on the type of intervention and its effectiveness. A reduction of
                the diarrhea disease burden through improved infrastructure would result in large decreases in the
                number of diarrhea cases treated with antibiotics. This was estimated as ranging from 5 million in
                Brazil to up to 590 million in India by the year 2030. The strong link between increased consumption
                and resistance indicates that this will directly mitigate the accelerating spread of AMR. Sanitation
                and water for all by 2030 is Goal Number 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals.
