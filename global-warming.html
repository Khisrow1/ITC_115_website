            <p class="paragraph">
                Global warming is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been
                demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the
                warming. It is a major aspect of climate change which, in addition to rising global surface
                temperatures, also includes its effects, such as changes in precipitation. While there have been
                prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been
                unprecedented in rate and scale.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that, "human influence on climate has
                been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century". These findings have been
                recognized by the national science academies of major nations and are not disputed by any scientific
                body of national or international standing. The largest human influence has been the emission of
                greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the impact from carbon dioxide and methane. Fossil fuel burning
                is the principal source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing
                significant roles. Climate sensitivity to these gases is impacted by feedbacks, such as loss of snow
                cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land surfaces are heating faster than the ocean surface, leading to heat waves, wildfires, and the
                expansion of deserts. Increasing atmospheric energy and rates of evaporation are causing more
                intense storms and weather extremes, damaging infrastructure and agriculture. Surface temperature
                increases are greatest in the Arctic and have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and
                sea ice. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their
                ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Surface temperatures
                would stabilize and decline a little if emissions were cut off, but other impacts will continue for
                centuries, including rising sea levels from melting ice sheets, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean
                acidification from elevated levels of carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Mitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy
                technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as
                the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also
                working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including improved coastline protection,
                better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention
                on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has near-universal membership. The goal of the convention is to
                "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". The IPCC has stressed the
                need to keep global warming below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid
                some irreversible impacts. With current policies and pledges, global warming by the end of the
                century is expected to reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F). At the current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
                rate, the emissions budget for staying below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) would be exhausted by 2028.

            <h1 class="header">Greenhouse Gases are the main culprits.</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Greenhouse gases trap heat radiating from the Earth to space. This heat, in the form of infrared
                radiation, gets absorbed and emitted by these gases in the atmosphere, thus warming the lower atmosphere
                and the surface. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases
                caused the air near the surface to be warmer by about 33 °C (59 °F) than it would be in their
                absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the
                freezing temperature of water. While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest
                contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore
                considered feedbacks. Increased concentrations of gases such as CO
                2 (~20%), ozone and N
                2O are external forcing on the other hand. Ozone acts as a greenhouse gas in the lowest layer of the
                atmosphere, the troposphere. Furthermore, it is highly reactive and interacts with other greenhouse
                gases and aerosols.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels, has
                increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs,
                and nitrous oxide has increased radiative forcing. In 2018, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had
                increased by about 45% and 160%, respectively, since pre-industrial times. In 2013, CO2 readings
                taken at the world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassing 400 ppm for the first time.
                These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which
                reliable data have been collected from ice cores. Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2
                values have not been this high for millions of years.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 excluding land use change were equivalent to 52
                billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Of these emissions, 72% was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning
                and industry, 19% was methane, largely from livestock, 6% was nitrous oxide, and 3% was fluorinated
                gases. A further 4 billion tonnes of CO
                2 was released as a consequence of land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation. From a
                production standpoint, the primary sources of global GHG emissions are estimated as: electricity and
                heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry (21%), and transportation (14%). Consumption
                based estimates of GHG emissions offer another useful way to understand sources of global warming, and
                may better capture the effects of trade. From a consumption standpoint, the dominant sources of
                global 2010 emissions were found to be: food (30%), washing, heating, and lighting (26%); personal
                transport and freight (20%); and building construction (15%).

            <h1 class="header">Is there still hope?</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Climate change can be mitigated through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or the enhancement of
                the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Near- and long-term
                trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C
                relative to pre-industrial levels. Pledges made as part of the Paris Agreement would lead to about
                3 °C of warming at the end of the 21st century, relative to pre-industrial levels. To keep warming
                under 1.5 °C, a far-reaching system change on an unprecedented scale is necessary in energy, land,
                cities, transport, buildings, and industry: but globally the benefits of keeping warming under 2 °C
                exceed the costs.

                Low-carbon energy technologies such as solar energy, wind energy have seen substantial progress over the
                last few years, but nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage have not improved similarly.
                Renewables are currently the cheapest source of new power generation but require energy storage for
                a continuous supply. Another approach is the installation of wide-area super grids in order to minimize
                local fluctuations of wind and solar energy. In addition to the expansion of renewable energy,
                decarbonisation in the energy sector also requires electrification and building a smarter and more
                flexible energy grid. The use of bioenergy may bring negative consequences for food security.
                Further measures in the energy sector include energy conservation and increased energy efficiency and
                decarbonizing buildings and transport.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                It has been suggested that the most effective and comprehensive policy to reduce carbon emissions is a
                carbon tax or the closely related emissions trading. Alternative effective policies include a
                moratorium on burning coal and a phase-out of energy subsidies which promote fossil fuel use,
                redirecting some to support the transition to clean energy. The development and scaling-up of clean
                technology, such as cement that produces less CO2, is critical to achieve sufficient emission
                reductions for the Paris agreement goals. Individual action on climate change to reduce a person's
                carbon footprint include: limiting overconsumption, living car-free, forgoing air travel
                and adopting a plant-based diet. Co-benefits of climate change mitigation may help society and
                individuals more quickly. For example, policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often also limit
                air pollution, improving public health.
